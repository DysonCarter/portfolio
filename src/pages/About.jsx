      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Akron who enjoys
        building React apps and interested in game theory and
        algorithmic problem-solving. I currently work with DataAnnotation, where
        I help train, evaluate, and improve AI models by producing high-quality,
        structured feedback.
